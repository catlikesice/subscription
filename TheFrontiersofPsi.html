<p>The 67th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association, held this July at the University of Freiburg, brought together leading researchers and scholars for three days of presentations, workshops, and spirited debate on the latest advances in psi research. The event’s program, curated by Dr. Michael Nahm and hosted by the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health (IGPP), showcased a diverse array of studies on extrasensory perception (ESP), psychokinesis, psychic healing, and altered states of consciousness.
A major theme this year was the integration of proof-oriented and process-oriented research. Several sessions revisited the classic Ganzfeld telepathy experiments, with new meta-analyses reaffirming small but statistically significant effects above chance, echoing the rigor of Honorton and Bem’s earlier work. Meanwhile, process-oriented approaches explored how belief systems, environmental factors, and psychological states modulate psi performance, with new data supporting the “sheep-goat effect”—the tendency for believers to outperform skeptics in ESP tasks.
Interdisciplinary collaboration was another highlight, with presentations on the intersection of parapsychology and neuroscience. Notably, Dr. Sam Parnia’s research on near-death experiences (NDEs) in cardiac arrest survivors continues to bridge medical science and parapsychology, bringing mainstream attention to phenomena once relegated to the fringes. The convention concluded with a call for greater methodological rigor, preregistration of studies, and open data sharing to enhance the field’s scientific credibility.</p>
